# MetoLabs\OtpAuthMigration

A simple PHP wrapper for the ```dim13/otpauth``` (https://github.com/dim13/otpauth) CLI tool to decode Google Authenticator migration URLs (```otpauth-migration://```) into usable TOTP secrets.

This package runs the ```otpauth``` CLI binary under the hood via [Symfony Process](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/process.html) and parses its output.

---
## Features

- Validate and locate the ```otpauth``` binary automatically or accept a custom path
- Decode migration URLs (```otpauth-migration://offline?data=...```)
- Return detailed TOTP secrets including issuer, account, secret, algorithm, digits, and period

---
## Requirements

- PHP 8.0+
- ```dim13/otpauth``` CLI binary installed and accessible in your system ```PATH```
- Composer dependencies installed (```symfony/process```)

---
## Installation

1. Install the ```dim13/otpauth``` CLI tool (requires Go):

``` 
go install github.com/dim13/otpauth@latest
```

Alternatively, you can download a prebuilt binary from the [releases](https://github.com/dim13/otpauth/releases/latest) page.

Make sure ```otpauth``` is in your ```PATH``` when using installer.

2. Install the package via Composer:

```
composer require metolabs\otpauth-migration-php
```
3. Add the ```OtpAuthMigration``` class to your project or include via your autoloader.

## Usage

```
<?php

use MetoLabs\OtpAuthMigration\OtpAuthMigration;
use Symfony\Component\Process\Exception\ProcessFailedException;

require __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

// Your otpauth-migration URL (usually from a QR code or export)
$migrationUrl = 'otpauth-migration://offline?data=CjQKFKuOm4V945mpzWoDXUoJMyfferkVEg5qZG9lQGdtYWlsLmNvbRoGQW1hem9uIAEoATACEAIYASAA';

// Create the wrapper instance (auto-finds binary in $PATH)
$otp = OtpAuthMigration::make();

try {
    $accounts = $otp->decode($migrationUrl);

    foreach ($accounts as $account) {
        echo "Issuer:   {$account['issuer']}\n";
        echo "Account:  {$account['account']}\n";
        echo "Secret:   {$account['secret']}\n";
        echo "Algorithm: {$account['algorithm']}\n";
        echo "Digits:   {$account['digits']}\n";
        echo "Period:   {$account['period']}\n";
        echo str_repeat('-', 20) . "\n";
    }
} catch (ProcessFailedException $e) {
    echo 'Failed to decode migration URL: ', $e->getMessage(), '\n';
}
```
 ---
## Constructor options

```
// Create an instance
$otp = new OtpAuthMigration();
// Create an instance statically
$otp = OtpAuthMigration::make();

// You can specify a custom path to otpauth binary (optional)
$otp = new OtpAuthMigration('/usr/local/bin/otpauth');

// Same parameter can be passed with static instanciation
$otp = OtpAuthMigration::make('/usr/local/bin/otpauth');
```
 ---
## Passing environment variables

```
$env = [
    'PATH' => '/custom/path:' . getenv('PATH'),
];

$accounts = $otp->decode($migrationUrl, $env);
```
